description: A tiny idea is capable of solving a monumental problem. Think outside of the box, but don't lie to yourself.
notes: >
  Think different.
  Be remarkable.
  It's okay to do things differently â€“ thinking from different perspectives.
  Almost everyone follows.
  Leave a legacy;
  do something different.
  Think different.
  Tell yourself the truth.
  Be honest with yourself.
  It's really hard to know if you're doing the right thing.
  Stand strong for the things you know.
  Question everything.
  The experts don't know.
  Learn to expose yourself to the worst case scenario.
  It's ok to just be human.
