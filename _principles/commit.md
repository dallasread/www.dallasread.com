description: Opportunities arise, then disappear. Be prepared for the chance, slow to commit, but stand strong in your decision.
notes: >
  Commit to the things you care about.
  The greatest work is achieved when the escape hatch is destroyed.
  Time is on your side.
  Take time to think & heal.
  Call out risks first.
  Consider trade-offs.
  Consider side-effects.
  Opportunities arise and fall.
  Consider how they will improve or curse your life.
  Many things beg for your time, energy, and resources.
  Keep control of your future.
  Or don't.
  Debt chains you.
  Optionality.
  Hold your cards close.
