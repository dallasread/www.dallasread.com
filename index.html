    I've traveled our beautiful world, looking at it from many perspectives.
    On my adventure, I've been quiet.
    I watched; I listened; I explored.
    I picked up some artifacts along my journey.
    To my surprise, many of them had, inscribed on them, secrets as to "how the world works."
    I've rigorously tested the claims using experience and evidence.
    At long last, I'm ready to share the things that I've been able to distill &mdash; honoured to have had the absurd luck of unearthing them along the way.

          Long before I ever considered joining the team, I was a <em>fan</em>.
          And customer.
          Having used the <em>other</em> domain registrars, there was something special about DNSimple's approach that resonated.
          Was it DNSound?
          Nah, just the lack upselling, cross-selling, and the get-in-and-do-my-work-and-get-out experience.

        <p class="mt-4 leading-8 text-gray-600">
          Fast-forwarding a <em>few</em> years, I now lead the Feature Engineering team.
          Seeing new features land in my own personal DNSimple account that I helped forge is an amazing thrill.
          Lately, we've been refining our workflow; hand-tuning our own version of Shape Up.
          Our tiny team has consistently released feature-after-feature in a mind-blowing 8-week cadence &mdash; including planning, design, implementation, support articles, internal documentation, and marketing work!
