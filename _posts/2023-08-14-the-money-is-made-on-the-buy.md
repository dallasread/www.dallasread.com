They say you shouldn't buy the nicest home in the neighbourhood. This is because it will always be sold at a discount. The values at the low end of the market will always tend to reach higher because of their potential.

<!-- As proof, we've bought "the worst real estate in the best neighbourhood" over a dozen times. "Common advice" is that you'll lose money on a property if you're not there more than a couple years. In every single one of our cases, we sold in less than a couple years (sometimes less than a year) &mdash; always made out like a bandit &mdash; and never lost! -->

Don't be in a hurry. Wait patiently for a deal at the low end (that is in proximity to high end). When you buy low, everything you do to the asset adds value.

You can make mistake-after-mistake and everything will still be okay. Because there is a goal in mind (lease/flip deadline), you keep pushing the progress forward; putting in sweat equity you don't even realize. You forget about the value you're creating because you're too busy complaining about problems, then solving them.
