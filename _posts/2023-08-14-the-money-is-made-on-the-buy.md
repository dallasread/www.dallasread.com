They say you shouldn't buy the nicest home in the neighbourhood. This is because it will always be sold at a discount. The values at the low end of the market, will always tend to reach higher because of their potential.

Don't be in a hurry. Wait patiently for a deal at the low end (that is in proximity to high end). When you buy low, everything you do to the asset adds value.

You can make mistake after mistake and everything will still be okay. Because there is a goal in mind (lease/flip deadline), you keep pushing the progress forward; putting in sweat equity you don't even realize. You forget about the value you're creating because you're too busy complaining about problems, then solving them.
