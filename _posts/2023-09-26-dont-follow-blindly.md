Humans are quick to find a pattern to mimic. We're quick to find a leader to follow. We long for a hero. We're in search for a template that serves us all the answers on silver platter.

I think this may be an immutable characteristic for some. But not for *you*.

If someone tells you something, question it. If something falls into your lap, don't assume it as *the answer* from the heavens. Look at it; measure it; contemplate it's side-effects; scrutinize it's source; and test it against the world around you.

If we all make the best decisions with the best available knowledge, the world will become a better place. Most often, the "best" decision is different for each of us.

Obedience is not a virtue.
