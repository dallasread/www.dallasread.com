Humans are quick to find a pattern to mimic. We're quick to find a leader to follow. We long for a hero. We're in search for a template that serves us all the answers on silver platter.

I think this may be an immutable characteristic for some. But not for *you*.

If something falls into your lap, it doesn't mean that is *the answer*. Look at it; scrutinize it; and test it.

If we all make the best decisions with the best available knowledge, we'll make the world a better place. Most often, the "best" decision is different for each of us.

Obedience is not a virtue.
