I've seen many ultra-talented people fail because they didn't make a habit out of hard work. There is no way around working hard and *really* trying your best. Certainly, you may not win today, but the good habits build a sentinel over time. Today's "win" isn't the goal &mdash; we're trying to win the long game.

When you're working hard, don't compare to others. It will give false security and fade your accomplishments. Compare to your past self; work toward goals for your future self.

Big wins are made when you're exhausted and laid out. They're made when you have no more to give. Only your habits can take you that final mile.

When you've finally put in the hours, put in the training, put in the work, you'll be at the top of your game. And winning will be *your* habit too.
