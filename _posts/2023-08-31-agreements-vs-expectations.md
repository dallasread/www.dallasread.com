Have you ever known the answer to a problem, but have a hard time convincing someone else? Or perhaps you've asked for something, but it wasn't fulfilled as desired. Have you known of someone that made a "hand-shake" deal with "friends" or "family" that went terribly wrong?

The work of working with people can be confusing and challenging. Each party has their own expectations, which can be a time-bomb for any project or relationship. More often than not, misaligned expectations end in regret, distrust, and failure.

Try replacing *expectations* with *agreements*.

*Before* a joint venture starts, make explicit agreements and boundaries by working *together* to uncover each other's hidden expectations about the venture. Then, use them to brainstorm, create, and record agreements that work for everybody.

In conversations, I ask "do you agree with..." questions to make sure I'm on the same page with someone. Tiny, conversational micro-agreements help identify where expectations diverge.

An important aspect of an agreement is the ability to change it when new information and situations inevitably arise. All parties should raise agreement-risking concerns as soon as possible to safeguard trust. Armed with the new reality, create a new amendment to the agreement that satisfies all parties.
