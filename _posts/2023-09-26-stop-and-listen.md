When it comes to holding productive conversations, I find group conversations to be much less productive than one-to-one conversations. When discussions happen in a group, the conversation tends toward generalities. This is why the idea of the "class clown" exists &mdash; it's an easy way to make a big splash as the lowest common denominator.

Sometimes I have something to say during a conversation &mdash; even conversation-shifting insights &mdash; but don't have enough room to say it. And the more a conversation goes on, the more time feels wasted on my end.

So, please pause.

Leave chunks of silence.

Check in with your conversee and listen to what they have to say.

And so will I. I'll be listening &mdash; until I'm confident that I have the most valuable piece of information to share.
